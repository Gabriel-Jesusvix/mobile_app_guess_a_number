## Appendix
Why use Expo in this project? 

* Expo is a tool used in mobile development with React Native that allows easy access to the device's native APIs without having to install any dependencies or change native code. 
The advantage is that in this format the developer starts very fast and in a few minutes he is creating his application, all the complicated parts were abstracted. The downside is exactly skipping these steps because not knowing the whole process of installing the Android SDK or XCode for iOS will limit you A LOT in the future to deal with application update and build processes.
